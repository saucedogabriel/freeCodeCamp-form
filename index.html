                <h2>About FreeCodeCamp</h2>
                <p> FreeCodeCamp is a community of people from all around the world who are learning to code together. We're a 501(c)(3) public charity..
                    You will learn to code by building dozens of projects, step-by-step, right in your browser, code editor, or mobile app.
                    You will also earn free verified certifications along the way.
                    You will learn the skills most developers use on the job: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Linux, Git, and SQL, and more. You'll also 
                    learn how to use powerful libraries for web development, mobile app development, data science, and artificial intelligence.
                <h3>How long does it take to learn all this?</h3>
                <p>FreeCodeCamp is self-paced. Realistically, it may take several years of practicing coding to learn these skills well enough to get a 
                    job as a software engineer. Don't quit school or your day job until you feel ready.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>FreeCodeCamp was launched in October 2014 and incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc. The founder, Quincy Larson, is a software developer who 
                    took up programming after graduate school and created freeCodeCamp as a way to streamline a student's progress from beginner to being job-ready.</p>
                <h3>Quincy Larson</h3>
                <p>Quincy Larson was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient.
                    His own journey into learning to code was long and windin and he recognized the need for a single-track curriculum for newbie developers. 
                    Upon analyzing data on coding boot camps in the US and realizing how inaccessible coding education was to the masses he set out to create a fully-online 
                    inclusive free platform for peer-driven learning of coding - the result of which is freeCodeCamp. <br>

                    He lives in Texas with his family and spends his time working on freeCodeCamp, writing and interviewing authors for the freeCodeCamp publication, 
                    co-ordinating open source projects such as Chapter (a free MeetUp alternative),[10] advocating for a free and open internet and playing with 
                    his two young kids.
                </p>
                <h3>Reception</h3>
                <p>freeCodeCamp's platform is used by about 350,000 unique visitors per month, with students from over 160 countries.[27]freeCodeCamp has 
                   international, community-run groups where students can interact in person. Some groups have been featured in local news, citing freeCodeCamp 
                   as an introduction to programming in order to fill the estimated vacancy in programming-related jobs in the next decade.[2</p>
